## Get started

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:

These are bugs/ feature requests where it has been determined that a change is required and this repo is open to any contribution from open source community.

- [Beginner issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-cli-extension/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ABeginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

- [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-cli-extension/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
