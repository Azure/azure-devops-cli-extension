## Output formats for Azure Devops CLI commands

The output formats are inherited from Azure CLI. You can set the default output format value by running following command.
```
az configure
```
You can find information about output formats [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/format-output-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)

The Azure CLI uses JSON as its default output option, but offers various ways for you to format the output of any command.  Use the `--output` (or `--out` or `-o`) parameter to format the output of the command into one of the output types.
