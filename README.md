# Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ms/azure-devops-cli-extension/_apis/build/status/Azure%20DevOps%20CLI%20-%20Merge%20GitHub?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ms/azure-devops-cli-extension/_build/latest?definitionId=39&branchName=master)

The Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI adds Pipelines, Boards, Repos, Artifacts and DevOps commands to the Azure CLI 2.0.

>The Azure CLI with the Azure DevOps Extension has replaced the VSTS CLI. The VSTS CLI has been deprecated and will no longer be receiving new features. We recommend that users of the VSTS CLI switch to the Azure CLI and add the Azure DevOps extension. See the [Command Mapping](/doc/command_mapping.md) section to view the mapping between VSTS CLI and Azure DevOps Extension commands.

## Quick start

1. [Install the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). You must have at least `v2.0.49`, which you can verify with `az --version` command.

1. Add the Azure DevOps Extension `az extension add --name azure-devops`

1. Run the `az login` command.

    If the CLI can open your default browser, it will do so and load a sign-in page. Otherwise, you need to open a
    browser page and follow the instructions on the command line to enter an authorization code after navigating to
    [https://aka.ms/devicelogin](https://aka.ms/devicelogin) in your browser. For more information, see the
    [Azure CLI login page](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/authenticate-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest).

See the [Get started guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/cli/get-started?view=azure-devops) for detailed setup instructions.

```bash
$az [group] [subgroup] [command] {parameters}
