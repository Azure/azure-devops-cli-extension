# Microsoft VSTS CLI 

We're excited to introduce *VSTS CLI*, a new command line interface for Visual Studio Team Services. VSTS CLI is currently in preview and we are working towards making this feature Generally Available. 

VSTS CLI is also supported on Team Foundatio Server 2017 update 2 and later.

# Features
A robust set of commands to work with and manage builds, code repositories, projects and work items in your Visual Studio Team Services account. This set of commands will continue to grow over time.

## Installation

Please refer to the [install guide](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-docs-install) for detailed install instructions.

Please refer to the ["get started" guide](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-docs-getstarted) for in-depth instructions.

For help content, pass in the `-h` parameter, for example:

```bash
vsts -h
vsts code -h
```

### Highlights

Here are some feature that can help you get the most out of the VSTS CLI 

#### Query

You can use the `--query` parameter and the [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) query syntax to customize your output.

```bash

## Reporting issues and feedback

If you encounter any bugs with the tool please report an issue on the [VSTS Developer Community](https://developercommunity.visualstudio.com/spaces/21/index.html?page=1&pageSize=15&sort=votes) using the vsts-cli tag.

To find where to provide feedback from the command line, use the `vsts feedback` command.

## Developer Installation

### Docker
Use `docker build` to create the image.

```bash
$ export CLI_VERSION=0.1.0b0.dev4335832
$ docker build --no-cache --build-arg BUILD_DATE="`date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"`" --build-arg CLI_VERSION=${CLI_VERSION} -f DockerFile . --tag vsts:${CLI_VERSION}
```

All command modules are included in this version as the image is built directly from the Git repository. Use `docker run` to create and run an instance of the new image. 

```bash
 $ docker run -it vsts:${CLI_VERSION}

# vsts -v
# vsts --help
```

## Developer Setup
