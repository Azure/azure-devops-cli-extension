# Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI


The Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI adds Pipelines, Boards, Repos, Artifacts and DevOps commands to the Azure CLI 2.0. 


> Azure DevOps extension is currently in preview but we encourage you to give it a try and provide feedback (or contribute).
With the release of Azure DevOps extension, we will be retiring the preview version of VSTS CLI. The Azure DevOps extension has functional parity with the VSTS CLI and we aim to deprecate the preview version of VSTS CLI by April, 2019.
