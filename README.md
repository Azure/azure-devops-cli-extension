# Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI


The Azure DevOps Extension for Azure CLI adds Pipelines, Boards, Repos, Artifacts and DevOps commands to the Azure CLI 2.0. 


> The Azure DevOps Extension is currently in preview but we encourage you to give it a try and provide feedback (or contribute).
With the release of the Azure DevOps Extension, we will be retiring the preview version of the VSTS CLI. The Azure DevOps Extension has functional parity with the VSTS CLI and we aim to deprecate VSTS CLI by April, 2019. 


# Installation

1. [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 
You must have at least `v2.0.49`, which you can verify with `az --version` command.
2. Add Azure DevOps Extension
`az extension add --name azure-devops`

# Usage
```
$az [group] [subgroup] [command] {parameters}
```
Adding the Azure DevOps Extension adds `devops`, `pipelines`, `artifacts`, `boards` and `repos` groups.
For usage and help content for any command, pass in the -h parameter, for example:
```
$az devops -h
```
- Documentation for all the commands is available at [Microsoft Azure CLI Docs - Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/ext/azure-devops/?view=azure-cli-latest). 
- Please refer the [Getting Started guide](/doc/getting_started.md) for detailed setup instructions. 
- Check out other examples in the [samples](/doc/samples.md) section.
