# Microsoft Visual Studio Team Services CLI 

VSTS CLI is a new command line interface for [Visual Studio Team Services](https://www.visualstudio.com/team-services/) (VSTS) and [Team Foundation Server](https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/) (TFS) 2017 Update 2 and later.

>The VSTS CLI has been deprecated and will no longer be receiving new features. We recommend that users of the VSTS CLI switch to the Azure CLI and add the Azure DevOps extension. See the [Command Mapping](https://github.com/Microsoft/azure-devops-cli-extension/blob/azuredevopscli-dev/doc/command_mapping.md) section to view the mapping between VSTS CLI and Azure DevOps Extension commands. 

## Get started

Refer to the [install guide](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-docs-install) for detailed install instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Also refer to the ["get started" guide](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-docs-getstarted) for in-depth instructions including first-time setup steps.

For help, pass the `-h` or `--help` argument, for example:

```bash
vsts -h
vsts code -h
```

### Commands

Use the VSTS CLI to work with and manage build, code repositories, projects, work items, and more in your VSTS account or on-premises Team Foundation Server collection.

Here are just a few of the commands:

* vsts build queue
* vsts code pr create
* vsts code pr list
* vsts code pr complete
* vsts code pr reviewers add
* vsts code pr work-items list
* vsts project create
* vsts work item create
* vsts work item update

See the full list of [available commands](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-commands).

### Login (setup credentials)

Create a personal access token and provide to the VSTS CLI via the login command:

```bash
vsts login --instance https://MYACCOUNT.visualstudio.com --token MYTOKEN
```

### Using VSTS CLI Behind a Proxy

The VSTS CLI picks the network proxy configuration from the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY`. 

### Configure defaults, Git aliases, and more

You can change your default settings using the `vsts configure` command, for example you can set the default output format for all commands. The options are:

* JSON
* JSON (with color highlighting)
* Table (human-readable tabular output)
* TSV (tab and new line delimited)

You can also add aliases in Git for certain VSTS CLI commands. For example, `git pr list` will be an alias for `vsts code pr list`.

### Querying and filtering output

You can use the `--query` parameter and the [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) query syntax to customize your output, for example:

```bash
Result
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Demos]\CLI Team
[Demos]\Demo Team
Fabrikam Fiber
```

### Examples and snippets

For more usage examples, see the official VSTS CLI [documentation](https://aka.ms/vsts-cli-docs-overview).
