# Azure Devops

Azure Devops CLI is a new command line interface for [Azure Devops Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/devops/) 

> Azure Devops CLI is currently in preview but we encourage you to give it a try and provide feedback (or contribute). 

## Get started

Refer to the [install guide](https://aka.ms/azure-devops-cli-docs-install) for detailed install instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

Also refer to the ["get started" guide](https://aka.ms/azure-devops-cli-docs-getstarted) for in-depth instructions including first-time setup steps.

For help, pass the `-h` or `--help` argument, for example:

```bash
az devops -h
az repos -h
```

### Commands

Use the Azure Devops CLI to work with and manage build, releases, code repositories, projects, work items, and more in your Azure Devops account or on-premises Team Foundation Server collection.

Here are just a few of the commands:

* az pipelines build queue
* az repos pr list
* az repos pr complete
* az repos pr reviewers add
* az repos pr work-items list
* az devops project create
* az boards work-item create
* az boards work-item update

See the full list of [available commands](https://aka.ms/azure-devops-cli-commands).

### Login (setup credentials)

Create a personal access token and provide to the Azure Devops CLI via the login command. You can follow any one of the below options for login:

1. All AAD or MSA users can run `az login` and they shall be able to run devops commands. 

2. Enter PAT token to be used against default URL
```bash
az devops login
```

3. Enter credential for particular account
```bash
az devops login --organization https://dev.azure.com/MY-ORGANIZATION-NAME/
```

4. In non-interactive mode: Fetch the PAT from a file and pass it on to login command
```
cat my_pat_token.txt | az devops login --organization https://dev.azure.com/MY-ORGANIZATION-NAME/
```

5. You can also store your PAT token in an environment variable called 'AZURE_DEVOPS_CLI_PAT' and skip 'az devops login' command for automation scenarios

### Using Azure Devops CLI Behind a Proxy

The Azure Devops CLI picks the network proxy configuration from the environment variables `HTTP_PROXY`, and `HTTPS_PROXY`. 

### Git aliases

You can also add aliases in Git for certain Azure Devops CLI commands. For example, `git pr list` will be an alias for `az repos pr list`.

### Querying and filtering output

You can use the `--query` parameter and the [JMESPath](http://jmespath.org/) query syntax to customize your output, for example:

```bash
Result
-------------------------------------------------------------
[Demos]\CLI Team
[Demos]\Demo Team
Fabrikam Fiber
```

### Examples and snippets

For more usage examples, see the official Azure Devops CLI [documentation](https://aka.ms/azure-devops-cli-docs-overview).
